# IOTA App for Ledger Blue & Ledger Nano S

Here we try to use natively available crypto logic to create IOTA Seeds and sign transactions on the fly. It's currently heavily in alpha so don't trust this yet!

See [Ledger's documentation](http://ledger.readthedocs.io) to get more info about the inner workings.

## How to get started

- Clone this repo, and set up your dev environment according to this: <https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-nano-s>

- Inside the folder of the repo you just cloned, run `make load` while your Ledger is attached, and unlocked and watch the magic happen. Be sure to connect your Ledger and open it at the dashboard to load the app.
